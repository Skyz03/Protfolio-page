# Protfolio-page
This is the portfolio page for the freecode Camp challenge.

### Overview
This challenge was taken from a freecode camp website where we have to built a personal portfolio website where it included: 
  1) The welcome section 
  2) The projects section 
  3) The contact section
  
Most of these section were accomplished using CSS ```FlexBox``` and ```Grid``` System.

### Future Development: 
The Hover state of ```span``` elements in the projects section can be imporved by incresing its area and giving it much more contrast color.
